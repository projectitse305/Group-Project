Our project name is "Hotelify"

Before launching our hotel management system, we looked for comparable systems to determine whether their goals were the same as ours and if their features were the same or different. We also conducted research to ensure that the project name was not already being used by another individual or business, in order to prevent issues and confusion for the system's developers and users.


So here are some examples and links to the projects that we found so you can check them out:
