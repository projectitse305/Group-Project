## The step for choosing the name for the project in open-source projects is considered one of the most critical steps that developers must consider before starting the project.
## In addition, it is considered a creative step, as developers choose a name that reflects the project's goals and motives.

## Our team went through several steps to select a name for the project we made a list of names that reflect the values of the project.
## The list of possible names:
- HotelTech
- Hotelify
- HotelPro

## Then, we took a vote among the team members to determine the name of the project.
## Most of the team members voted for the three names on the list.
## Our decision on the project name was influenced by the following factors:  
- Ensure that the project name is unique to avoid duplication.
- The project's name reflects its purpose and its motivation. 
- The project name is memorable and easy to pronounce.
- Easy to find.
