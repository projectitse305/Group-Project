The step for choosing the name for the project in open-source projects is considered one of the most critical steps that developers must consider before starting the project.
In addition, it is considered a creative step, as developers choose a name that reflects the project's goals and motives.

Our team went through several steps to select a name for the project we made a list of names that reflect the values of the project.
The list of possible names:
1.HotelTech
2.HotelifyMaster
3.HotelPro

Then, we took a vote among the team members to determine the name of the project.
Most of the team members voted for the three names on the list.
Our decision on the project name was influenced by the following factors:  
1. Ensure that the project name is unique to avoid duplication.
2. The project's name reflects its purpose and its motivation. 
3. The project name is memorable and easy to pronounce.
4. Easy to find.
