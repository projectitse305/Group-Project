Development status of the project:

Since the project's inception, no developers have yet to put it into practice. Nonetheless, we have completed the project's first phase, in which we designed the project's layout as well as all of its features and functionalities for its initial release.We have included a well-thought-out strategy that outlines the anticipated start date for the project's code implementation. 
Every developer that joins the project will begin working in the code right away, and they are welcome to contribute their thoughts if they believe the original idea needs to be changed or improved upon. Our goal is to enhance each version and make it better than the one that came before it.
