# Developrs GuideLines:
> Having a set of guidelines, can improve your abilities as a developer and also help you to make decisions ahead of time rather than on the spot.


> Here we list guidelines that could help you in your process of development, this covers:

. communication policy
. Coding instructions
. Documentations
. Bugs and issues tracking


## Communication policy:

 An effective communication policy reduces disputes and miscommunications by encouraging meaningful communication among developers.
 Here are some of the most important policies:
 1. the communication should be truthful and ethical.
 2. Developers must Be open to feedback from other developers or users.
 3. Developers  communicate through Email and MSTeams ( for instant replays you can communicate through the MSTeams ).
 
 *If you are a user and have a query about the project feel free to contact the developers through Email or MSTeams:
  . MSTeam: Hotelify@outlook.com  
  . Email: Hotelify@gmail.com 
  

## Coding instructions:

# Code styling Guidelines:

1. Naming local variables and constant, Function:
 naming functions and variables clearly will help others to understand the use of these attributes.
 . variables' names should be meaningful.
 . The name of the function should be clear and state the purpose of using the method.
 . the class names should be related to their purpose.
 . Avoid using the same identification more than once. 

 
2. Here are some additional coding style suggestions that can enhance the code's readability and comprehension:
 . code must be organized and clear to develop.
 . Add comments to explain the code.
 . each function of the code is specified to perform one task only, so it's easy to developer understand it.
 . variables data types are clear to the developer.
 . The coding style should be simple to easily maintain it 


# Code documentation:

1. provide documents describing the flow of the system.
2. live notifications for any updates in the document.
3. Mark functions that are incomplete or under processing.


# Bug and issue tracking :


1. Use team project management tools : 

 	Such as https://asana.com/  
  to maintain the project tasks of handling bugs and issues, the website could assign 
  tasks to specific developers and developers could monitor the progress of a certain task if it's under processing or completed or created.
  
2. provide details information about the bug or issue. providing the user with a specific format to follow when reporting the bug or issue:
